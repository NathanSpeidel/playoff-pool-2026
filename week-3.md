---

## Available Players by Position & Team

### QUARTERBACKS

**Elite Tier:**
- **Drake Maye (NE)** - TOP CHOICE
  - 26.16 pts in Divisional Round (3 TDs vs Houston)
  - MVP candidate: 4,394 pass yards, 31:8 TD:INT, 450 rush yards
  - Patriots -5.5 favorites vs backup QB Stidham
  - Mobile QB adds rushing floor

**Risky Tier:**
- **Matthew Stafford (LAR)** - 10.22 pts in Divisional (0 TDs)
  - MVP candidate but inconsistent lately
  - At Seattle (tough environment)
  - 276.9 pass yards, 2.7 TDs per game in regular season

- **Sam Darnold (SEA)** - 10.96 pts in Divisional
  - Limited upside
  - At home vs Rams
  - Seahawks may lean on run game

**Avoid:**
- **Jarrett Stidham (DEN)** - Backup QB
  - Hasn't thrown a pass since 2023
  - 78.3 career passer rating
  - Facing strong Patriots defense

---

### RUNNING BACKS

**Top Tier:**
- **Kenneth Walker III (SEA)** - STRONG OPTION
  - 1,027 rush yards, 5 TDs, 31 rec for 282 yards
  - At home vs Rams
  - High-scoring game expected (O/U 47.5)
  - Concern: Zach Charbonnet vultures goal-line TDs

- **Rhamondre Stevenson (NE)** - HOT HAND
  - 12.1 pts in Divisional
  - ON FIRE: 461 scrimmage yards, 6 TDs in last 4 games
  - Eye injury during Divisional game (monitor status)
  - Positive game script if Patriots lead vs Stidham

**Mid Tier:**
- **RJ Harvey (DEN)** - 11.6 pts in Divisional
  - Rookie getting opportunities
  - With backup QB, Broncos may run more to protect Stidham
  - Risky but could see volume

**Backup Tier:**
- **Blake Corum (LAR)** - Kyren Williams' backup
  - Very limited role behind Kyren (who we can't use anyway)
  - Only viable if Kyren gets injured

---

### WIDE RECEIVERS

**Elite Tier:**
- **Davante Adams (LAR)** - TOP CHOICE
  - Only 4.4 pts in Divisional (2 rec, 24 yards) - CONCERNING
  - BUT: 14 TDs in 14 games this season!
  - Elite talent, TD machine
  - At Seattle (tough defense)

**Solid Tier:**
- **Cooper Kupp (SEA)** - REVENGE GAME
  - Former Super Bowl MVP
  - Playing vs former team (Rams released him)
  - At home
  - With JSN drawing coverage, Kupp could feast

- **Courtland Sutton (DEN)** - RISKY
  - 1,017 yards, 7 TDs in regular season
  - Playing with backup QB Stidham
  - Stidham may check down more = fewer deep shots

**Limited Options:**
- **Kayshon Boutte (NE)** - Patriots WR
- **DeMario Douglas (NE)** - Slot receiver
- **Tutu Atwell (LAR)** - Speed receiver

---

### TIGHT ENDS

**Note:** This is the weakest position available. All options are limited.

**Best Available:**
- **Hunter Henry (NE)** - Disappointing 1.5 pts in Divisional
  - Usually reliable (15.4 pts in Wild Card)
  - Red zone target for Maye
  - If Patriots control game, could see work

- **Colby Parkinson (LAR)** - Rams TE1
  - Limited but gets targets
  - Could benefit from Stafford looking for safety valve

- **Noah Fant (SEA)** - Seahawks TE
  - Inconsistent
  - Kupp and JSN (burned) dominate targets

- **Adam Trautman (DEN)** - Broncos TE
  - Limited role
  - Backup QB situation hurts passing game

---

### KICKERS

**Top Choices:**
- **Jason Myers (SEA)** - RECOMMENDED
  - High-scoring NFC game expected (O/U 47.5)
  - At home (easier kicks)
  - Seahawks likely to score

- **Chad Ryland (NE)** - Solid option
  - Patriots favored, should score
  - Outdoor game at altitude

- **Joshua Karty / Harrison Mevis (LAR)** - Decent
  - Mevis hit 42-yard OT winner vs Bears

- **Wil Lutz (DEN)** - Risky
  - Broncos offense limited with Stidham
  - May get field goal attempts if drives stall

---

### DEFENSES

**ELITE TIER:**
- **New England Patriots D/ST** - TOP CHOICE
  - FACING BACKUP QB JARRETT STIDHAM!
  - Picked off CJ Stroud 4 times in Divisional
  - Healthy and rolling
  - Stidham has 8 INTs in 197 career passes (turnover prone)

- **Seattle Seahawks D/ST** - ELITE
  - Dominated 49ers 41-6 in Divisional
  - #1 run defense (3.7 ypc allowed)
  - #1 pass defense (6.0 ypa allowed)
  - "Legion of Boom" comparisons
  - At home

**SOLID TIER:**
- **Denver Broncos D/ST** - Good but facing Maye
  - Led league in DEFi this season
  - But facing MVP candidate Drake Maye

- **Los Angeles Rams D/ST** - Decent
  - Strong defensive line
  - At Seattle (tough environment)

---

## Strategic Analysis

### Game Script Predictions

**AFC: Patriots at Broncos**
- Patriots likely to control game vs backup QB
- Stidham may struggle, turnovers expected
- Patriots could jump to early lead
- Game script: Patriots ahead, running clock, Stevenson gets work
- Drake Maye may not need huge numbers if defense dominates
- BUT: Maye's rushing ability adds safe floor

**NFC: Rams at Seahawks**
- Closer game expected
- Shootout potential (O/U 47.5)
- Both teams split regular season series
- Kenneth Walker should get volume at home
- Davante Adams has TD upside even in tough matchup

### What Others Might Pick

- JSN (21 entries) - BURNED
- Loveland (19 entries) - BURNED
- James Cook (12 entries) - ELIMINATED

- Josh Allen (5 entries) - ELIMINATED

**Likely popular Week 3 picks:**

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### **OPTION A (Balanced High-Ceiling)**

**Our Week 3 Picks:**
| Position | Player | Team | Projected |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|
| QB | Drake Maye | NE | 25-30 pts |
| RB | Kenneth Walker III | SEA | 15-20 pts |

**Teams Used:** NE, SEA, LAR, DEN (all 4 different teams )

**Projected Total:** 75-103 points

---

### Why This Is The Best Strategy:

**1. Best QB Available**
- Drake Maye is the clear QB1 of remaining options
- MVP candidate with 31:8 TD:INT ratio
- Mobile QB adds rushing floor (450 rush yards)
- Patriots are -5.5 favorites

**2. Kenneth Walker in Premium Spot**
- At home in high-scoring game (O/U 47.5)
- Seahawks are Super Bowl favorites
- 1,027 rush yards + 282 receiving yards

**3. Davante Adams TD Upside**
- 14 TDs in 14 games this season
- Elite talent even in tough matchup
- Better than Sutton with backup QB

**4. Patriots D is Elite Matchup**
- Facing backup QB Jarrett Stidham
- Stidham hasn't thrown a pass since 2023
- 78.3 career passer rating, turnover prone
- Patriots picked off Stroud 4 times last week

**5. Accept TE Weakness**
- All TE options are weak
- Trautman fills the 4th team requirement
- Focus scoring on other positions

**6. Jason Myers in High-Scoring Game**
- NFC Championship expected to be shootout
- At home = easier kicks
- Seahawks should score

---

## Alternative Considerations

### If Rhamondre Stevenson is Healthy
Consider swapping Walker for Stevenson:
- Stevenson is ON FIRE (6 TDs in 4 games)
- But must change WR to Kupp (SEA) or Sutton (DEN)
- This requires restructuring the whole lineup

### If You Want to Differentiate
- Cooper Kupp revenge narrative is compelling
- Fewer people may pick Kupp vs Adams
- But Adams' 14 TDs > Kupp's season production

### Monitor Before Submission
1. **Rhamondre Stevenson eye injury** - May affect his status
2. **Any late injury news** - Especially Walker or Adams
3. **Weather in Seattle** - Usually rainy, may affect passing

## Scoring Reminder (Week 3 Additions)

**Standard Scoring:**
- 1 point per 25 passing yards
- 1 point per 10 rushing/receiving yards
- 1 point per reception (PPR)
- 6 points per touchdown
- 2 points per two-point conversion

**Kicker Scoring:**
- 1 point per extra point
- 3 points per field goal under 50 yards
- 5 points per field goal 50+ yards

**Defense Scoring:**
- 10 points for allowing 0-2 points
- 5 points for allowing 3-9 points
- 6 points per defensive/special teams TD
- 2 points per sack/fumble recovery/interception/safety

---

## Confidence Level

**Win Probability with Option A:** Competitive for #1

**Key Advantages:**
- Drake Maye is consensus best QB
- Patriots D facing backup is near-optimal
- Kenneth Walker in good spot
- Davante Adams TD upside differentiator

**Key Risks:**
- TE position is weak (everyone faces this)
- Adams had poor Week 2 (4.4 pts)
- Stafford's inconsistency affects Adams

**Bottom Line:** This lineup maximizes points at the positions we can control while accepting the weak TE options everyone faces.
