	I feel like a bunch of teams are gonna have the same lineup I do 
	Based on the picked players so far in the league 


Elwin Possible Canada Number Possible Canada Number:
	Well… there are a few choices…

Chris poveromo:
	But as far as the correct choice 
	I’m was torn but now I feel like I gotta go Maye, Walk 3, Davante, Engram, Myers, NE
	Was gonna do Kyren and Sutton at first 
	But now that Charbonnet is out…
	Regardless, I feel the pot is gonna get split more than 2 ways 
	My prediction 
	Unless some random lineup wins it all
