## Strategic Considerations for Round 2

### Key Decisions to Make:

**1. Do we deploy Josh Allen (BUF) now or save for Round 3?**
- **PRO:** Best QB in playoffs, guaranteed elite production, Bills have good matchup vs Broncos
- **CON:** Conference Championships (Round 3) competition will be tougher
- **Alternative:** Use Bo Nix (DEN - fresh off bye), Caleb Williams (CHI - hot hand), or Brock Purdy (SF)

**2. Do we deploy Christian McCaffrey (SF) now or save for Round 3?**
- **PRO:** Elite RB, averaged 29.4 pts in Wild Card, 49ers still playing
- **CON:** May want to save for finals
- **Alternative:** Use D'Andre Swift (CHI - 17.2 pts R1), Kyren Williams (LAR - 15.5 pts R1), or Woody Marks (HOU - hot)

**3. George Kittle injury status - What's our TE plan?**
- **If Kittle OUT:** Colston Loveland (CHI) is the obvious choice - 23.7 pts R1, historic performance
- **If Kittle PLAYING:** Decide between Kittle (elite but coming off injury) vs Loveland (hot hand)
- **Other options:** Hunter Henry (NE - 15.4 pts R1), Dalton Kincaid (BUF - 11.8 pts R1)

**4. WR Position - Best Available:**
- **Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA):** Record-breaking season (1,793 yards), fresh off bye
- **Courtland Sutton (DEN):** 1,017 yards, 7 TDs in 2025, fresh off bye
- **Christian Kirk (HOU):** 8/144/1 TD in Wild Card - elite performance!
- **Cooper Kupp:** Need to clarify which team (Rams or Seahawks?)
- **DJ Moore (CHI):** Bears' WR1

### Teams with Fresh Legs (Had Bye Week):
- ✅ **Denver Broncos** - Bo Nix, Courtland Sutton, RB committee
- ✅ **Seattle Seahawks** - Sam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Kenneth Walker III

### Hot Hands from Wild Card:
- 🔥 **Colston Loveland (CHI):** 23.7 pts - historic TE performance
- 🔥 **Christian McCaffrey (SF):** 29.4 pts - 2 TDs, dual-threat
- 🔥 **Caleb Williams (CHI):** 30.44 pts - epic comeback
- 🔥 **Christian Kirk (HOU):** Led Texans with 8/144/1
- 🔥 **Woody Marks (HOU):** 112 rush yards, 1 TD

### Matchup Considerations:

**Competitive Games (Higher Scoring):**
- Bills @ Broncos (likely shootout)
- 49ers @ Seahawks (competitive NFC game)
- Rams @ Bears (rematch potential)

**Potential Blowouts (Game Script Risk):**
- Texans @ Patriots (could go either way)

## Round 2 Recommendations - Strategic Options

### OPTION A: Deploy Josh Allen + CMC (Go Big Now)
**Rationale:** Use our two best assets while competition is still manageable (only 25 people left)

- **QB: Josh Allen (BUF)** - Elite, guaranteed production
- **RB: Christian McCaffrey (SF)** - Elite dual-threat
- **WR: Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA)** - Record-breaker, fresh off bye
- **TE: Colston Loveland (CHI)** - Hot hand, historic performance

**Teams Used:** BUF, SF, SEA, CHI
**Pros:** Maximum scoring potential, dominant lineup
**Cons:** Uses our two best players, limited firepower for Round 3

---

### OPTION B: Conservative (Save Allen for Finals)
**Rationale:** Deploy CMC but save Allen for when field narrows to ~12-13 people

- **QB: Caleb Williams (CHI)** - Hot hand, 30.44 pts in comeback win
- **RB: Christian McCaffrey (SF)** - Elite, worth deploying
- **WR: Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA)** - Record season
- **TE: Colston Loveland (CHI)** - Can't use if using Caleb Williams!
  - **Alternative TE: Hunter Henry (NE)** - 15.4 pts R1

**Teams Used:** CHI, SF, SEA, NE
**Pros:** Saves Josh Allen for finals
**Cons:** Caleb Williams riskier than Allen

---

### OPTION C: Save BOTH Allen + CMC (Ultra-Conservative)
**Rationale:** Try to advance with second-tier options, keep all elite weapons for finals

- **QB: Bo Nix (DEN)** - Fresh off bye, 4th quarter specialist
- **RB: D'Andre Swift (CHI)** - 17.2 pts R1
- **WR: Courtland Sutton (DEN)** - 1,017 yards, fresh off bye
- **TE: Colston Loveland (CHI)** - Can't use if using Swift!
  - **Alternative: Hunter Henry (NE)** - 15.4 pts R1

**Teams Used:** DEN, CHI, NE
**Pros:** Saves Allen + CMC + Cook + Kittle for finals
**Cons:** Lower ceiling, risky with only 25 people advancing

---

## Critical Information Still Needed:

1. ✅ **George Kittle injury status** - Is he playing or out with Achilles injury?
2. ✅ **Cooper Kupp clarification** - Which team is he actually on? (Search showed both SEA and LAR)
3. ✅ **Vegas lines & O/U totals** - Which games project highest scoring?
4. ✅ **Weather forecasts** - Denver (Mile High) and Seattle conditions?
5. ✅ **Updated fantasy projections** - Expert consensus for Divisional Round

---

## Next Steps:

1. Check George Kittle injury report
2. Research Divisional Round fantasy projections
3. Get Vegas O/U totals for each game
4. Make final decision on Allen/CMC deployment strategy
5. Check weather for Denver and Seattle games
6. Review matchup analysis for each game
