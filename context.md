## Week 2 (Divisional Round) - PLANNING

### Teams in Divisional Round
**AFC:**
- Kansas City Chiefs (bye week, #1 seed) - fresh team
- Buffalo Bills (likely advanced from Wild Card)
- [Winners of other AFC Wild Card games]

**NFC:**
- Detroit Lions (bye week, #1 seed) - fresh team
- Philadelphia Eagles (likely advanced from Wild Card)
- [Winners of other NFC Wild Card games]

### Key Information Needed for Week 2 Strategy

**MUST RESEARCH:**
1. Which teams actually won in Wild Card Round
2. Divisional Round matchups and game lines
3. Which of our saved elite players are available (Bills/49ers likely playing)
4. Fantasy projections for Divisional Round
5. Weather forecasts (especially for GB, BUF, DET games)
6. Injury reports for key players

### Week 2 Strategic Considerations

**Competition Level:**
- Only top 50% from Week 1 remain
- Competition is TOUGHER - may need to deploy elite players
- Still need to save something for Conference Championships (Week 3)

**Ideal Week 2 Approach:**
- Deploy 1-2 saved elite players (likely Josh Allen or CMC)
- Try to save at least ONE of: Allen, CMC, or Kittle for Week 3
- Consider using bye week teams (KC, DET) if they have good matchups
- Balance scoring high enough to advance vs. preserving for finals

**Key Questions to Answer:**
1. Do we use Josh Allen in Week 2 or save for Week 3?
2. Do we use CMC in Week 2 or save for Week 3?
3. Can we get away with using James Cook instead of CMC?
4. Which bye teams (KC, DET) have the best fantasy matchups?

## PPR Value Reference - Key Stats

### Reception Leaders (2025 Season)
**Running Backs:**
- Saquon Barkley (PHI): 78 rec, 592 yards, 6 TDs ❌ USED
- Christian McCaffrey (SF): Elite target share, ~4-5 rec/game ✅ AVAILABLE
- James Cook (BUF): 33 rec, 291 yards, 2 TDs ✅ AVAILABLE
- Travis Etienne (JAX): 40 rec, 488 yards, 2 TDs ✅ AVAILABLE (if JAX advanced)
- Jahmyr Gibbs (DET): Check if available
- De'Von Achane (MIA): Check if available

**Wide Receivers:**
- Puka Nacua (LAR): 129 rec, 1,820 yards, 11 TDs ❌ USED
- Amon-Ra St. Brown (DET): Elite PPR if available
- Tyreek Hill (MIA): Elite PPR if available
- AJ Brown (PHI): High target share ✅ AVAILABLE
- Cooper Kupp (LAR): ✅ AVAILABLE

**Tight Ends:**
- George Kittle (SF): Elite target share ✅ AVAILABLE
- Dalton Kincaid (BUF): 11 projected pts ✅ AVAILABLE
- Dallas Goedert (PHI): 12 projected pts ✅ AVAILABLE
- Dalton Schultz (HOU): ❌ USED

### Why PPR Matters
- **1 point per reception** means volume receivers are gold
- A player with 5 catches, 50 yards = 10 PPR points from receiving alone
- High-target RBs like CMC and Cook are extremely valuable
- Prioritize players with 5+ target games in PPR format

## Week 3 (Conference Championships) - FINAL PLANNING

### Format Change
- This round determines THE WINNER (not just advancement)
- Need to maximize total points (not just top 50%)
- Also select Kicker + Defense
- Only 4 teams playing (2 AFC, 2 NFC)

### Reserved for Week 3 (If Possible)
**Best Case Scenario - Save These:**
- 1 elite QB (Allen or Purdy)
- 1 elite RB (CMC or Cook)
- 1 elite TE (Kittle or Kincaid)
- 1 elite WR (from remaining options)
- Best available Kicker
- Best available Defense

**Realistic Scenario:**
- May need to use Allen or CMC in Week 2
- Try to preserve Kittle + one other elite player for Week 3

---

## Strategic Framework for Week 2 Decision

### Option 1: Deploy Josh Allen
**When to do this:**
- If Bills have an elite matchup
- If competition is tight and you need points
- If you can save CMC + Kittle for Week 3

**Pros:**
- Best QB in playoffs, 22 PPG average
- 14 rushing TDs = elite PPR upside
- Virtually guarantees advancement

**Cons:**
- Burns your best QB
- May need him more in Week 3

### Option 2: Deploy Christian McCaffrey
**When to do this:**
- If 49ers have an elite matchup
- If CMC is healthy and full workload expected
- If you can save Allen + Kittle for Week 3

**Pros:**
- Highest RB projection (26 pts)
- Elite PPR value with receiving work
- Dual-threat capability

**Cons:**
- Burns your best RB
- James Cook is a solid backup but not as good

### Option 3: Conservative (Use James Cook + other options)
**When to do this:**
- If your other options look strong enough
- If you want to save BOTH Allen and CMC for Week 3
- If matchups favor this approach

**Pros:**
- Preserves both elite players
- Cook still very good (led NFL in rushing)
- Maximum firepower for Week 3

**Cons:**
- Lower ceiling for Week 2
- Risk of not advancing if competition is tough

## Important Reminders

1. **Full PPR Scoring** - Receptions are worth their weight in gold
2. **Can't Reuse Players** - Once used, they're gone forever
3. **Can Reuse Teams** - Different player from same team is allowed
4. **Week 2 Competition** - Only top half remains, likely tougher competition
5. **Week 3 is Winner-Take-All** - Need your best lineup for finals
6. **Check Injury Reports** - Key players could be hurt
7. **Weather Matters** - Cold weather games affect passing games
8. **Game Scripts** - Blowouts reduce garbage time opportunities
9. **Vegas Lines** - Higher O/U totals = more fantasy points expected

---

## Next Steps for Week 2 Strategy

1. ✅ Confirm Wild Card results (who advanced)
2. ✅ Get Divisional Round matchups and Vegas lines
3. ✅ Check injury reports for Allen, CMC, Kittle, Cook
4. ✅ Get fantasy projections for Divisional Round
5. ✅ Analyze whether to deploy Allen vs CMC vs neither
6. ✅ Identify best WR and TE options from advancing teams
7. ✅ Make final decision balancing Week 2 advancement vs Week 3 firepower
