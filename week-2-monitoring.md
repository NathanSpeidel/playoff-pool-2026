## KEY ITEMS TO MONITOR

### 🚨 CRITICAL - Injury Reports

#### 1. Josh Allen (BUF) - Our QB Pick
**Current Status:** ACTIVE but banged up
**Injuries:** Knee twist, shoulder injury, foot issue
**Source of Concern:** Checked in medical tent twice vs Jaguars, limping after game

**MONITOR DAILY:**
- ✅ **Wednesday Practice Report** (Jan 14)
  - Full participant? Limited? DNP (Did Not Practice)?
- ✅ **Thursday Practice Report** (Jan 15)
- ✅ **Friday Practice Report** (Jan 16)
- ✅ **Injury Designation Friday** - Out/Doubtful/Questionable/None
- ✅ **Saturday Morning Updates** - Any last-minute changes

**IF ALLEN RULED OUT OR LIMITED:**
- **Switch to Option B or C** (use Caleb Williams or Bo Nix)
- **Or switch QB to:** Brock Purdy (SF), Matthew Stafford (LAR), Drake Maye (NE)

**Where to Check:**
- Bills official injury report (released Wed/Thu/Fri)
- Twitter: @BuffaloBills, @AdamSchefter, @RapSheet
- Buffalo Bills beat reporters

---

#### 2. Matthew Stafford (LAR) - Affects Kyren Williams/Rams Offense
**Current Status:** ACTIVE but hand concern
**Injury:** Throwing hand issue
**Evidence:** Betting line moved from Rams -4.5 to -3.5 (concern about his hand)

**MONITOR:**
- ✅ Practice participation reports
- ✅ Rams coaching staff comments
- ✅ Whether he throws in practice without issues
- ✅ Any reports about grip strength/ball velocity

**IF STAFFORD COMPROMISED:**
- Rams offense less potent
- Kyren Williams could see more carries (good) but worse game script (bad)
- **CONSIDER:** Switching RB to D'Andre Swift (CHI), James Cook (BUF), or Woody Marks (HOU)
  - **NOTE:** Can't use James Cook if using Josh Allen (same team rule)

---

#### 3. Other Key Players to Monitor

**Christian McCaffrey (SF):**
- Any reports of injury or illness?
- If we decide to switch to Option B (use CMC), need confirmation he's 100%

**Colston Loveland (CHI):**
- Rookie TE - any injury concerns after physical Wild Card game?

**Jaxon Smith-Njigba (SEA):**
- Fresh off bye - should be healthy, but monitor anyway

**Kyren Williams (LAR):**
- Any injury concerns?

### 📊 Vegas Line Movements

**Current Lines (as of Jan 13):**
