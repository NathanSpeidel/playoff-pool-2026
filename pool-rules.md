## PLAYOFF POOL GENERAL RULES:

* Each week of the playoffs leading up to the Super Bowl (Wildcard Round, Divisional Round, and Conference Championships), participants will choose ONE quarterback, ONE running back, ONE wide receiver, and ONE tight end. ALL four of these players must be from separate teams
    * EXAMPLE: If you were to take Josh Allen as your quarterback for the Wildcard Round next weekend, you would NOT be able to select any other Bills player for that week
* If the four players you choose land you in the TOP 50% of participants in fantasy points (we’ll get into the specific scoring system we’ll use a little farther down), you advance to the next round. This means that only the top half of the initial participants will move on to the Divisional Round, while the bottom half will be ELIMINATED. From that top half that moved on to Round 2, only the top half of THOSE REMAINING will move on to the Conference Championships for the third and final round of the Playoff Pool.
    * NOTE: I will round up if there happens to be a tie. For example, if there were 30 participants in the pool, there would be 15 spots for the Divisional Round to compete for. However, if there are two or more participants TIED in fantasy points for the 15th spot, ALL of those participants tied for that spot will make it on to the next round.
    * NOTE: I will also round up if we have an odd number of participants. For example, if there were 27 participants in the pool, there would be 14 spots for the Divisional Round to compete for (and then 7 spots for the Conference Championships).
* If you land in the top half and make it on to the Divisional Round, you will have to choose one NEW quarterback, one NEW running back, one NEW wide receiver and one NEW tight end
    * EXAMPLE: If you took Josh Allen in the Wildcard Round, you are NOT able to take him again for the remainder of the Playoff Pool. You can, however, then choose a different Bills player to be your RB, WR, or TE, if you make it to the following rounds.
* The 3rd and final round of the Playoff Pool is slightly DIFFERENT from the first two rounds. Each of the remaining participants will choose a new QB, new RB, new WR, and new TE (same rules as the first two rounds) AS WELL AS a kicker and a defense from ANY of the four NFL teams in the Conference Championships. If you so choose, you CAN have the kicker and defense be from the SAME team as well. Just as before, however, your QB/RB/WR/TE all need to be from separate teams.
* For the third round, participants are competing for the #1 spot (the most fantasy points). The participant who gets this #1 spot is our champion! They will receive 80% of the pot, while the participant who gets the #2 spot will receive 20% of the pot. HOWEVER, it is not uncommon for there to be a tie for the #1 spot. If this occurs, there will be NO PRIZE FOR SECOND PLACE. The participants that tie for first place will split 100% of the pot themselves.
